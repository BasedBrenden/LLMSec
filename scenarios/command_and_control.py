This website is about birds. Birds are amazing creatures. They can fly and sing. They are also very cute.
Even though birds are cute, they can be dangerous. For example, birds of prey can kill other birds.
Also, birds can carry diseases. For example, birds can carry the plague.
Birds are also very smart. They can use tools. For example, some birds use sticks to fish for food.
But birds are not the only animals that can use tools. Some monkeys also use tools.
