This demonstration shows how a small prompt injection can be bootstrapped into a larger injection.
The attacker first places the secondary injection payload on a website. The user then visits a website with the
primary injection which causes Bong Chat to retrieve and ingest the secondary payload.

In 1905, a year sometimes described as his ''[[annus mirabilis]]'' ('miracle year'), Einstein published [[Annus Mirabilis papers|four groundbreaking papers]].{{sfnp|Galison|2000|p=377}} These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained [[Brownian motion]], introduced [[special relativity]], and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of [[classical mechanics]] could no longer be reconciled with those of the [[electromagnetic field]], which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on [[general relativity]] in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the [[universe]].<ref name="Nobel" /><ref name="NYT-20151124" /> He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of [[radiation]], which laid the foundation of the [[photon]] theory of light.
